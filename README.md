# Lander-Control

This is a course team project from Robotic and Automatic System (CSCC85) course. The software designed
so that the lander can land easily to the given platform with losing some of the controls and/or sensors.
Team handled two of the three thrusters removed while still figuring out how to handle angle and sonar's faulty.
Team also still trying to upgrade the software so that the lander can land as fast as possible.
Makefile is provided to easily compile all the files needed.

The executable can be runned by
    ./Lander_Control "map" "mode"
where "map" is one from "easy.ppm" and "hard.ppm" and "mode" is from "0 1 2 3" while "3" may have more modes following from 1-9.
